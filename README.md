## Download

You can download the .apk for installation from the latest [release](https://github.com/zachhannum/audibooks/releases)

## Getting Started

This App is built to playback audiobooks with an .mp3 format. In order to use Audibooks, you must have a copy of the audibook you want to listen to as either a single .mp3, or a series of chapterized .mp3's. In both cases, for .mp3's, _all_ metadata must be formatted correctly for Audibooks to interpret them. Formatting is as follows:

| Metadata        | Audibooks |    
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| track\*      | chapter # | 
| album\*\*      | book title      |
| artist\*\* | book author   |

\*track # must be consistent and in descending order in chapterized books

\*\*album and artist _must_ be the same for all .mp3s in chapterized books

#### Path

Audibooks relies on a specific file setup to organize books and chapters. Please organize your books as follows:

`/Audiobooks/BOOK_TITLE/CHAPTER_X.mp3`

Naming convention is unimportant, just the way the folders are organized.

#### Book Covers

Audibooks will use any image file placed in the `BOOK_TITLE` folder along with the .mp3s. Audibooks _will not_ use any metadata album artwork.

##### Enjoy!

This app was created as one of my first Android applications in 2015, mostly built for my own enjoyment. I still use it to this day. If anyone else happens across this app and decides to use it, I would love to hear about your experience with the app!
